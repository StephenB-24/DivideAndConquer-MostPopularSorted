# Divide and Conquer - Find the Most Popular Element of a Sorted List
A divide and conquer appraoch to finding the most popular element in a sorted list.

Results are analyzed for correctness using brute-force to generate all valid possible answers.

The runtime of the algrorithm is also broken down and analyzed with Master Theorem in the following text.

<h2>The Problem</h2>

Given a sorted list of comparable elements, return the most popular.

The most popular element is the one that occurs the most, or as much as, any other element in the list.

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

Picture to-be-inserted

<h2>Files Included</h2>

- Solution.java => This is where the divide-and-conquer solution lies
- BruteForce.java => This is where problem generation, the brute-force solver (finds all valid solutions per example), and the brute-force solution checker lie.
- Run.java => The main method lies here. It calls methods from above in a specific fashion, and is thoroughly commented for the reader.

<h2>Runtime - Master Theorem</h2>

Further explanation soon.
